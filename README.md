# Documentation Medphys Web App - X-Ray Machine Quality Report

This project is a web application developed in PHP, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS that helps medical physicists create quality reports for X-ray machines. The application allows users to enter the necessary data through a form, upload report photos, and export the data as JSON to a MAKE webhook. The application also integrates with a SQL database to store and retrieve the entered data. MAKE uses a predefined Google Documents template to receive the variables and present them in a detailed report ready for export as a PDF and sending to the client.
